            <h2>Travelling</h2>
            <p>I have a passion for travelling, international destinations or remote areas within Australia. Each is a unique experience that lets me connect with family and the places around me.</p>

            <h2>Four-Wheel Drive Adventures</h2>
            <p>I lead many four-wheel drive trips to the Victorian High Country and Australiaâ€™s remote deserts. These great adventures let me find new experiences with friends and learn the great outback of Australia.</p>

            <h2>Golfing</h2>
            <p>Golfing is one of my favorite pastimes. I enjoy the challenge it brings and the opportunity to spend time outdoors. Even if it doesn't work out all the time its a nice walk!</p>

            <h2>Movies and films</h2>
            <p>I love watching movies across various genres. Whether it's a drama or a comedy, films provide a wonderful escape and a chance to engage in the great world of storytelling.</p>

            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>Reading is a good hobby of mine. I enjoy delving into a nice novel to kick back and fall into the wonderful worlds created by authors, or reading through a great informative piece.</p>

            <h2>Hands-On Engineering</h2>
            <p>My background in engineering has fostered a love for hands-on projects. I find joy in applying my knowledge to practical tasks and developing creative solutions to everyday challenges.</p>

            <h2>Personal Hobbyist Projects</h2>
            <p>I engage in various personal hobbyist projects, including building model aeroplanes. This hands-on work allows me to combine my engineering skills with my love for creativity and craftsmanship.</p>
